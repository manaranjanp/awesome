## Overview

Data Science is emerging as a hot new profession and academic discipline.  Harvard Business Review says Data Scientist is the Sexiest Job of the 21st Century. But demand for data scientists is racing ahead of supply. People with the necessary skills are scarce, primarily because the discipline is so new. This course is designed to give a start and introduction to this new discipline. This course is spread across 2 days and will have a plenty of hands on exercises on real world data.
