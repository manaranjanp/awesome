We will find as far as basic human development factors like literacy, access to safe drinking water, access to sanitation, BPL and number of doctors per 1000 people are concerned, how different states have fared. We will check which all states are doing

We will use Govt. provided data and check if there are any changes. If yes, we try to figure out if these changes are significant.

The data is collected from various sources below.

## Literacy Rates?

Kerala, Mizoram, Himachala Pradesh and Goa are ahead of others. Western states and few north and north-eastern states clearly doing well as far as Literacy Rates are concerned. Central, Eastern states are laggards.

## Access to Safe Drinking Water

Some startling insights! In God's own country, kerala, only 38% or less have access to safe drinking water. [Here](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/70-houses-in-kerala-lack-access-to-safe-drinking-water/article2996919.ece) is an article that concurs this. Most of the northern and southern states have done well. Western states also lagging except Gujrat. States like Odisha, Jharkhand and few north-east states have lacked in providing safe drinking water to it's people.

<b>That's all for now. In the next post, I will look at some more stats regarding access to sanitation and how many doctors per 1000 persons.</b>
